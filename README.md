# poor-mans-smu
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/
It's based on https://github.com/hellange/easysmu (a working prototype for EasySMU and 5" capacitive touch display)

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/

The schematics directory contains various schematics that have been scanned from other sources.
Just to keep it somewhere. The scehematics are not related to the code at all.
