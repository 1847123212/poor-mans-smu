# poor-mans-smu
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/
