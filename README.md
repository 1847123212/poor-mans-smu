# poor-mans-smu
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/
It's based on https://github.com/hellange/easysmu (a working prototype for EasySMU and 5" capacitive touch display)

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/, especially https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/5-800x480-capacitive-touch-lcd-with-built-in-ft811-graphics-controller/


Note:
The refs/ directory contains stuff that is not relevant for the source code. Just to keep it somewhere.
